Problem Statement
Keeping pictures in a picture book is a problem for many users. Sometimes family members remove pictures or borrow the book indefinitely. Some pictures get ruined over time and start to fall apart. 
Project Scope
Create the page structure for an image user interface that uses figure and figure caption for each image. Use HTML elements that are the standard elements for creating images in HTML pages. Add attributes to your page that enforce images to be the same size for a consistent look and feel. Center the pictures horizontally on the page. 

Download three images from the web. Ensure the image uses a Creative Commons license (CC). Add the HTML to the page that will ensure all the images are the same height and width. Add a clickable link that will take the user out to a webpage. It can link to any page you want or it can link back to the source page the image was copied from online. Ensure you add all the attributes for the image tag.
